#### Dichotomy of control

Some things are up to us, othe things are not.


What then is the proper training for this? In the first place, the principal and most important thing, on the very threshold so to speak,
is that when you are attached to a thing, not a thing which cannot be taken away but anything like a water jug, or a crystal cup, 
you should bear in mind what it is, that you may not be disturbed when it is broken.

So should it be with persons; if you kiss your child, or brother, or friendâ€¦ you must remind yourself that you love a mortal, 
and that nothing that you love is your very own; it is given you for the moment, not for ever nor inseparably,
but like a fig or a bunch of grapes at the appointed season of the year, and if you long for it in winter you are a fool. 

So too if you long for your son or your friend, when it is not given you to have him, know that you are longing for a fig in winter time.
