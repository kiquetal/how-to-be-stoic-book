- 'Material things are indifferent,but how we handle them is not indifferent.' Epictetus

Our actions may be impeded by [others], but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.‚Äù Marcus Aurelius
