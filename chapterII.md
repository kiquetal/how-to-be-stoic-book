#### Chapter II

    What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that flows
    smoothly? - Epictetus, Discourses 1.4

#### Summary

   Zeno studied under Crate.
   Initially is followers were, predictable enough, called Zenonians,
   eventually they began to be referred to as 'Stoics', because
   they met under the Stoak Poikile, or painted porch, a public place
   in the center of the city.


   There are three departments in which a man who is to be good and noble must be trained. The first concerns the will to get and will to avoid; he must be trained not to fail to get what he wills to get nor fall into what he wills to avoid. The second is concerned with impulse to act and not to act, and, in a word, the sphere of what is fitting: that we should act in order, with due consideration, and with proper care. The object of the third is that we may not be deceived, and may not judge at random, and generally it is concerned with assent


These are often referred to as the three Stoic disciplines: desire, action, and assent.
